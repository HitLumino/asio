 * @li All of the data in the supplied buffers has been written. That is, the
 * bytes transferred is equal to the sum of the buffer sizes.
 *
 * @li An error occurred.
 *
 * This operation is implemented in terms of one or more calls to the device's

 * the SyncRandomAccessWriteDevice concept.
 *
 * @param offset The offset at which the data will be written.
 *
 * @param buffers One or more buffers containing the data to be written. The sum

 * device.
 *
 * @returns The number of bytes transferred.
 *
